Instead of zones or groups, this airline uses binary space partitioning to seat people. A seat might be specified
like FBFBBFFRLR, where F means "front", B means "back", L means "left", and R means "right".
The first 7 characters will either be F or B; these specify exactly one of the 128 rows on the plane
(numbered 0 through 127). Each letter tells you which half of a region the given seat is in.
For example, consider just the first seven characters of FBFBBFFRLR:

Start by considering the whole range, rows 0 through 127.
F means to take the lower half, keeping rows 0 through 63.
B means to take the upper half, keeping rows 32 through 63.
F means to take the lower half, keeping rows 32 through 47.
B means to take the upper half, keeping rows 40 through 47.
B keeps rows 44 through 47.
F keeps rows 44 through 45.
The final F keeps the lower of the two, row 44.
The last three characters will be either L or R; these specify exactly one of the 8 columns of seats on the plane
(numbered 0 through 7). The same process as above proceeds again, this time with only three steps.
L means to keep the lower half, while R means to keep the upper half.

For example, consider just the last 3 characters of FBFBBFFRLR:

Start by considering the whole range, columns 0 through 7.
R means to take the upper half, keeping columns 4 through 7.
L means to take the lower half, keeping columns 4 through 5.
The final R keeps the upper of the two, column 5.
So, decoding FBFBBFFRLR reveals that it is the seat at row 44, column 5.
